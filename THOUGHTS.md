This sounds like a genuinely useful package! Let me break down my thoughts:

1. Is this useful?
   Yes, absolutely. There's a real gap in the market for lightweight, vanilla JS solutions that don't require frameworks. Many developers need quick list management without the overhead of React/Vue or complex state management.
2. Use cases where this would be valuable:
   Immediate use cases:

Todo lists and task managers
Shopping lists and inventory tracking
Quick note-taking interfaces
Form builders (adding multiple entries)
Tag/category management
Contact lists or simple CRM interfaces
Event planning (guest lists, items needed)
Educational tools (vocabulary lists, quiz questions)

Developer scenarios:

Prototyping and MVPs
Legacy projects that can't add heavy frameworks
Simple admin interfaces
Client-side demos before backend integration
Educational projects teaching vanilla JS

3. What would make it better?
   Core functionality:

Persistence options: LocalStorage, SessionStorage integration
Validation: Built-in input validation rules
Templates: Customizable list item templates
Drag & drop: Reordering list items
Bulk operations: Select multiple items, bulk delete
Import/Export: JSON/CSV support for data portability

Developer experience:

TypeScript definitions: Even for vanilla JS users
Event system: Hooks for onAdd, onDelete, onChange
Theming: CSS custom properties for easy styling
Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
Multiple instances: Handle multiple lists on one page

Advanced features:

Search/filter: Built-in list filtering
Categories: Group items by type
Due dates: For task-oriented lists
Undo/redo: Action history

The concept has legs! Start simple but design the API to be extensible. The vanilla JS angle is actually a selling point in today's framework-heavy world.RetryDThanks for the feedback. So releasing it in it's most basic form would be a good idea?EditYes, absolutely! Releasing it in its most basic form is a smart strategy. Here's why:
Why start basic:
Get real user feedback early - You'll learn what features people actually want vs. what you think they want
Validate the core concept - Make sure the fundamental idea resonates before investing in advanced features
Establish your API - Lock in the basic interface early, then extend it without breaking changes
Build momentum - Getting something out there creates accountability and motivation to keep improving
Avoid feature creep - It's easy to over-engineer before you know what users really need
What "basic" should include:

Core functionality: form submission → list item creation
Basic configuration (list type, styling options)
Simple item removal/editing
Clean, documented API
Good README with examples

How to set yourself up for success:

Version it properly - Start at 0.1.0, signal it's early but functional
Document the roadmap - Let users know what's planned
Make the API extensible - Design hooks/events from the start
Keep breaking changes minimal - Plan the API structure thoughtfully

The vanilla JS market is actually hungry for well-made, focused libraries. Many developers are tired of framework bloat for simple tasks. Ship it, get it in front of people, and iterate based on real usage patterns.
What's your timeline for getting the basic version out?RetryDNo timeline, it is a hobby project. Is Listly a name that may have conflicts with other projects i am not aware of?EditListly npm package javascript library10 resultsfirebase-tools - npmnpmjs.comSearch, sort, filters, flexibility to tables, list and more! - List.jslistjs.com30 Most Popular NPM Packages for Node JS Developers | Turingturing.comNode.js — An introduction to the npm package managernodejs.orgnpm | Homenpmjs.comlistr - npmnpmjs.comlistjs - npmnpmjs.comJavaScript Flaws: 5 stupid NPM packages - DEV Communitydev.toGitHub - javve/list.js: The perfect library for adding search, sort, filters and flexibility to tables, lists and various HTML elements.

Existing similar packages:

list.js - "The perfect library for lists. Supports search, sort, filters and flexibility" list.js - npm - This is quite popular and does similar things
listr - "Terminal task list" listr - npm - Different use case but similar name
listjs - Though this is for displaying JS files, not list management listjs - npm

Potential issues with "Listly":

list.js is the main concern - it's an established library that does list manipulation (though more focused on search/sort/filter)
The name is very close to existing list-related packages
"Listly" might be confused with the popular content curation platform Listly.com (not a JS library, but still a web product)

Suggestions:
Consider these alternatives that feel more unique:

form-lister - Descriptive of what it does
dynamic-list - Clear functionality
list-builder - Emphasizes the building aspect
vanilla-lists - Highlights the vanilla JS angle
form-to-list - Very descriptive
quick-list - Simple and memorable

Since it's a hobby project, you could start with "Listly" and see if there are actual conflicts, but having a backup name ready might save you headaches later if you need to rebrand.
What do you think of those alternatives, or does "Listly" still feel right to you?
